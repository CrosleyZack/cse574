Literature Review Notes:
1. Markov Decision Processes with Functional Rewards:
	- Develops a generic framework for markov decision projects with non-scalar reward schemes.
	- Necessary for a problem of this complexity.
2. Emerging Issues in Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure.
	- Discusses the strategies for disclosing known vulnerabilities taking into account the costs, both to repair and reputation costs from disclosing publicly.
3. Would a 'Cyber Warrior' Protect Us? Exploring Trade-offs Between Attack and Defense of Information Systems.
	- Finds that a stable, defensive equilibrium is not possible in cyber warfare and one party will always be incentivized to attack.
	- Indicates a necessity for researching an exploitation strategy.
4. How Shall We Play a Game?
	- Using new strategies finds that all vulnerabilities are disclosed only if full exploit reflection is possible.
